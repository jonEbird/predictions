Predictions
===========

Fun little webapp for tracking the predictions made on football games amongst
friends. This is a toy web application primarily used for education in playing around with
new technology.

Development
-----------

Originally the website was built with Python 2.5 and was an experiment with early web
frameworks and database ORMs and the like. It's embarrassing to look at that old code and
now we're making a shift into new territory. If you'd like to view the Python code, see
the [legacy][legacy] branch.

Going forward we'll be re-creating the application with [Go][Golang] and [React][React].
